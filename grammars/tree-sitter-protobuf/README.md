# tree-sitter-proto

[tree-sitter][] grammar for protocol buffer files (proto3 only).

[tree-sitter]: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Status

The grammar should be complete. I'm still working on the highlighting queries.
I've tested the grammar against some really large and nasty proto files
and it passes. Once the highlighting is stable, I'll tag 1.0.
